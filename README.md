# Welcome to PantryCheck 

> A tool designed to ease the burden of planning your next trip to the grocery store <br>( o˘◡˘o) ┌iii┐ ( ・・)つ-●●●

### Application Overview

For some, grocery shopping is stressful and time-consuming. It can be hard to keep track of what’s in your pantry, and even more difficult to keep in mind the shelf-lives of various items. Adequately planning for your next run to the grocery store can save you time and money.

My main goal for this application was to gain a deeper understanding of how to utilize Django Models to build an interface with a sufficient relational database.


## Features

* Users can add, edit and delete personalized grocery items to their profile
