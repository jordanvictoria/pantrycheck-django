# Welcome to PantryCheck 

> A tool designed to ease the burden of planning your next trip to the grocery store <br>( o˘◡˘o) ┌iii┐ ( ・・)つ-●●●

### Application Overview

For some, grocery shopping is stressful and time-consuming. It can be hard to keep track of what’s in your pantry, and even more difficult to keep in mind the shelf-lives of various items. Adequately planning for your next run to the grocery store can save you time and money.

My goals for this application were to incorporate full CRUD functionality with many-to-many relationships, gain a deeper understanding of React Hooks, props, and state, while also incorporating an intuitive, functional user interface, without the use of bootstrapped components.


## Features


Features include:
* Users can add, edit and delete personalized grocery items to their profile
* Users can create, edit and delete grocery lists
* Users can add grocery items to their grocery lists, and subsequently edit or remove them
* Users can search for grocery items in the search bar
* Users can filter items on their list by their category and/or priority value
